# Smart Mirror

The smart mirror tutorial from raspberry pi uses a local installation of [MagicMirror2](https://github.com/MagicMirrorOrg/MagicMirror).

I do not like local installations and wanted to keep everything on my server. So, I am hosting this and just display the webpage on the pi. This makes maintenance easier.


Here is a source of my `config.js` file

```js
let config = {
	address: "0.0.0.0",	// Address to listen on, can be:
	port: 8080,
	basePath: "/",	// The URL path where MagicMirrorÂ² is hosted. If you are using a Reverse proxy
	ipWhitelist: [],	// Set [] to allow all IP addresses

	useHttps: false,			// Support HTTPS or not, default "false" will use HTTP
	httpsPrivateKey: "",	// HTTPS private key path, only require when useHttps is true
	httpsCertificate: "",	// HTTPS Certificate path, only require when useHttps is true

	language: "en",
	locale: "de-DE",
	logLevel: ["INFO", "LOG", "WARN", "ERROR"], // Add "DEBUG" for even more logging
	timeFormat: 24,
	units: "metric",

	modules: [
