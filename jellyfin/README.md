# Jellyfin
My media server.
I tried Plex as well, but jellyfin was faster and better suited for my server.

The most annoying part about invidious is the app landscape. The apps for apple tvOS was not working for me at all (its third party, so not really their fault), so I had to watch everything on the Android-TV instance included with my TV (In the meantime I have switched to Kodi, which has served me VERY well and I have no issues anymore).
